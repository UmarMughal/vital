    h2 A minimally invasive CSS framework for modern web applications.

    h2 Vital is a reverse approach to "everything and the kitchen sink" CSS frameworks.
    hr
    p Vital is hyper-minimal by design, the advantages you gain in this framework are:
    ul
      li Lightweight (~20KB minified)
      li Quick and easy to learn
      li Fairly style agnostic and easy to customize
      li Easy to read, write and maintain
      li Modify vital directly from the source (or overridden if you prefer)
      li No deep nesting or excessive markup and classes
    h3 Less &rang; More
    p Some frameworks include an overwhelmingly and unnecessary amount of code. Vital is built on the principal that less is more. Working with less code means:
    ul
      li Less bugs to squash.
      li Less documentation to read.
      li Work more productively.
    h3 Designed for large and small, teams
    p Often times, large CSS frameworks are brought into projects for the purpose of speed. If a project grows and needs to scale, the effectiveness and workflow efficiency starts to fall and cause more problems than they solve.

    h2 Vital Vectors
    p Font Icons have become very popular, but most libraries simply have either too many icons resulting in a very large set of iconograpgy font files, or lack the capability to allow your application icons to diverge into their own unique style. So we've included a Font Custom template for you to be able to quickly generate your own unique set of iconograpgy.
    p Take a look at our custom vectors guide for more information.
